# OverTheWire Writeups
[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/) offers **wargames** to help you learn and practice security concepts in a hands-on, gamified environment. 

Each game provides a series of challenges to strengthen Linux, networking, binary exploitation, cryptography, and web security skills.

## Wargames Tracks
Suggested order for beginners:

- **Bandit** – Unix/Linux basics  
- [Natas](./natas/index.md)** – Web security  
- **Krypton** – Cryptography
- **Leviathan** – Reverse engineering  
... more to be added as I play along 

*Each wargame uses its own SSH port — instructions for connecting are provided on the OverTheWire site.*
