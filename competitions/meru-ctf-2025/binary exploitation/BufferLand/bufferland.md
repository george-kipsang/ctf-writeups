## Description

Welcome to Bufferland, an ancient realm where knowledge is power and memory is brittle. A humble strory-teller invites you to share your tale - but beware: beyond his soft words lies a vulnerable stack. Only by telling a long enough story will you bend the flow of fate and uncover the vault he guards. You've found an unprotected binary, and i's waiting for your input. But nothing you say seems to impress it - unless you're willing to step out of bounds

## Hint 

"Those who overwrite the past shall change their future."
The vault lies just beyond 64 characters ...

## Solution

I began by making the binary executable and running it to observe its behavior

```bash
chmod +x chall 

./chall  
```

![chall](./assets/chall.png)

 The program greeted me with a message about "Bufferland" and prompted for input. Entering a string just resulted in a generic response, with no flag revealed.

Next, I used `strings` to scan for any readable text within the binary

```bash
$ strings chall  
```

![strings](./assets/strings.png)

This revealed several interesting lines, one including the flag

To confirm, I also loaded the binary into `Cutter` for disassembly. Searching through the strings and functions, I found the flag hardcoded

```bash
cutter chall
```

---

```
Flag : flag{buffering_into_the_void}
```
