# 🛡️ CTF Writeups

This repository contains my personal collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) and cybersecurity challenge writeups.  
It is divided into two major sections:

---

## 📁 1. Platform-Based CTFs

These are challenges completed on popular online cybersecurity platforms.

### Included Platforms
- [HackTheBox](./platforms/hackthebox/index.md)
- [TryHackMe](./platforms/tryhackme/index.md)
- [The Hackers Lab](./platforms/thehackerslab/index.md)
- [VulnHub](./platforms/vulnhub/index.md)
- [OverTheWire](./platforms/overthewire/index.md)

Each platform is organized by machine/challenge name, and every writeup follows a consistent format with screenshots stored in an `assets/` folder and referenced using standard Markdown:
