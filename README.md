# 🛡️ CTF Writeups

This repository contains my personal collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) and cybersecurity challenge writeups.  
It is divided into two major sections:

---

## 📁 1. Platform-Based CTFs

These are challenges completed on popular online cybersecurity platforms.

### Included Platforms
- [HackTheBox](./platforms/HackTheBox/)
- [TryHackMe](./platforms/TryHackMe/)
- [VulnHub](./platforms/VulnHub/)
- [OverTheWire](./platforms/OverTheWire/)

Each platform is organized by machine/challenge name, and every writeup follows a consistent format with screenshots stored in an `assets/` folder and referenced using standard Markdown:

## 🏆 2. Competition-Based CTFs

These are writeups from formal competitions, events, and school-based cybersecurity contests.

### Included Competitions
