# 🛡️ CTF Writeups¶
This repository contains my personal collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) and cybersecurity challenge writeups.
It is divided into two major sections:

## 📁 1. Platform-Based CTFs¶
These are challenges completed on popular online cybersecurity platforms.

Included Platforms¶
[HackTheBox](./hackthebox/index.md)
[TryHackMe](./tryhackme/index.md)
[VulnHub](./Vulnhub/index.md)
[OverTheWire](./OverTheWire.md)
Each platform is organized by machine/challenge name, and every writeup follows a consistent format with screenshots stored in an assets/ folder and referenced using standard Markdown:

## 🏆 2. Competition-Based CTFs¶
These are writeups from formal competitions, events, and school-based cybersecurity contests.

Included Competitions¶
[PicoCTF](./picoctf/index.md)
[Meru CTF 2025](./meructf2025/index.md)
(More will be added as I participate in new events)
